  #   `defaults write -g CGFontRenderingFontSmoothingDisabled -bool NO`

  # This is a global setting and will require a log out or restart to take

# Visual Bell

# Any time the BEL code is received, Alacritty "rings" the visual bell. Once
# rung, the terminal background will be set to white and transition back to the

# configure the transition function by setting the `animation` property.
